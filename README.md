# task_1_shoppinp_cart_ios

***** Briefing / Task *****
1. Complete the task using the Swift language.
2. 3rd party frameworks are not allowed.
3. Unit tests are a good plus.

- Write a mobile application and associated unit tests that can price a basket of goods in a number of different currencies
- The goods that can be purchased, which are all priced in US$, are:
  • Peas: $ 0,95 per bag
  • Eggs: $ 2,10 per dozen
  • Milk: $ 1,30 per bottle
  • Beans: $ 0,73 per can
- The program shall allow the user to add or remove items in a basket. The user can click on a checkout button, 
which will then display the total price for the basket with the option to display the amount in different currencies. 
For example, if the basket contained milk and the currency selected was EUR with an exchange rate of 1.1, 
the total would be 1.43 EUR.
- No UI design constraints are enforced so feel free to design the UI in the way you see as most appropriate for the solution.
- The list of currencies shall be consumed from http://jsonrates.com/. To convert to other currencies, you will need to create an account. This will then issue you with an API-Key that permits reading from the various public APIs listed on their site. The exchange rates may change at any time.

***** Known issue *****
